# the-lstv/Undertale

An Undertale fangame engine, creted entirely from scratch.<br>
So far its very early indevelopment but features a fast and feature-rich text renderer that can handle basically all your Undertale text needs, including individual sprite handling.<br>
On top of that the engine features all the standard features like scenes, universal event handling, etc.<br>
It makes creating Undertale fangames a lot easier.
