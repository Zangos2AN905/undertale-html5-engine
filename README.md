# Undertale HTML5 Engine

"A robust Undertale fangame engine, creted entirely from scratch, pure code, no WYSIWYG.<br>
Uses WebGL for rendering, and thus is also really fast and flexible." - the-lstv, 2024 or 2025

This is a fork that is also a WIP, it adds more stuff and prob will finish this someday
