# the-lstv/undertale

A robust Undertale fangame engine, creted entirely from scratch.<br>
Uses WebGL for rendering, and thus is also really fast and flexible (temporarily the splashscreen is in DOM/SVG, I am working on fully integrating it into WebGL).<br><br>
So far its early in development, but features a fast and feature-rich text renderer that can handle basically all your fangame text needs, including individual character behavior.<br>
On top of that the engine features all the standard features like scenes, universal event handling, etc.<br>
It makes creating Undertale fangames a lot easier.
<br><br>
Check out /game/game.js to see the game logic.
<br><br>Written entirely in JS.<br>
Version 1.0 [alpha 1.0]
